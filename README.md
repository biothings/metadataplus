## Overview
Embedding structured metadata in web pages provide explicit clues about the meaning of the content for both machine and users. This practice has been increasingly embraced to facilitate the discovery of information and is critical to facilitating reproducibility of research results and enabling scientists to build on othersâ€™ work. Metadataplus adds structured metadata to existing sites in schema.org standard. Visit http://metadataplus.biothings.io/ to learn more about this practice and see examples.
